## 🪄 Overview

The **150K Lyrics Classifier** is an advanced natural language processing (NLP) project designed to automatically classify song lyrics by genre and emotion. Leveraging a robust dataset of over 150,000 unique lyrics, this project tackles the challenge of large-scale text classification in the music domain, where linguistic diversity and subtle emotional markers are key.

Built using Python and industry-standard ML libraries (scikit-learn, pandas), the project offers:
- End-to-end pipeline from data cleaning to model evaluation
- Customizable feature engineering (TF-IDF), multi-model training (Logistic Regression, SVM)
- Interactive Streamlit app for live predictions, results visualization, and user engagement

By automating lyric analysis, this project demonstrates applied machine learning in entertainment analytics—showcasing skills across NLP, model deployment, and user-focused app development. Recruiters see best practices in code organization, reproducibility, and impactful communication.

## 🤔 Motivation & Impact

The explosion of digital music platforms has made it crucial to understand song content at scale—for recommendation systems, playlist curation, and music analytics. Manual tagging is slow, inconsistent, and impractical for vast lyric databases. This project automates the process by applying advanced NLP and machine learning, enabling:

- Fast, reliable prediction of song genre and emotional tone from raw lyrics
- Insights into songwriter trends, audience preferences, and commercial potential
- Improved music discovery and user engagement on streaming platforms

By bridging the gap between raw text and actionable metadata, this project highlights how machine learning can power better entertainment experiences and business decisions.
